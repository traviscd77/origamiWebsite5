          <h2>The Art</h2>
          <img src="images/japanese-text.gif" width="300" height="92" alt="Japanese text for Origami" class="float-left">
          <p>The word <i>origami</i> stems from two Japanese words – <i>Oru</i> (meaning to fold) and <i>Kami</i> (meaning paper). The ancient art of paper folding <em>originated in China</em> around the first century <abbr title="anno Domini">A.D.</abbr> and made its way to Japan by about the sixth century.
          <p>Traditional origami requires the folding of a single uncut square. <strong>Cutting is not permitted, nor is gluing or any type of adhesive.</strong> Modular origami, however, involves folding several smaller units and joining them together. Again, gluing is frowned upon as a well-designed model should lock into place on its own.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most renowned origamist is <u>Yoshizawa</u>&nbsp;Akira, born in Japan in <time datetime="1911">1911</time>. Not only is he responsible for the design of well over 50,000 origami models, but he is credited with single-handedly popularizing the art. Perhaps his most well-known design is the <cite>Japanese&nbsp;Good&nbsp;Luck&nbsp;Demon</cite>.</p>
